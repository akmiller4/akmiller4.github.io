This diagram is to help me decide which class assignments to work on first. The first thing I do is write down each assignment I have, and then the due date for each assignment.
I choose which class to start on depending on what the nearest due dates are. 
I then have all three of my classes in the diagram and the due dates for the assignments for each.
